Run `node express.js` to run the REST Api with SQLite database.

## Pictures
All the Placeholder-Pictures were found on google while searching for the according super hero name. If I used your picture without your permission I'm very sorry about that. Just write an e-mail and I'm going to delete it.

I assure you I don't use them to make money in any way.
